Changes made:
--index.html
1.Added bootstrap.css for setting up initial styles to all elements across page.
2.Added loader div to show initial loading text until all products are fetched.

--product-template.html
1.Made use of bootstrap grid layout to show contents
2.Added product description div for each product.
3.Added close(X) button for each product.

--styles.css
1.Added floats whereever required, transitions for product mouseover, changing font-sizes of elements,
 aligning e.t.c

--script.js
1.Added callbacks for fetching products. setTimeout is removed and instead called methods as callbacks on getJson response function. This eliminated buggy product loading.
2.Showing loader div before ajaxstart and hiding after ajaxcomplete for user to know that the page is still loading until the page renders.
3. Added onclick functionality to close-button to remove product from dom. Added smooth animation while this happens.
4.Removed  products in blocks of 3, instead they flow evenly one after the other.
